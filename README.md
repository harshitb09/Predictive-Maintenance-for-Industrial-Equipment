# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Equipment

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance model to forecast equipment failures in an industrial setting. By leveraging historical sensor data, the model helps reduce downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and lower maintenance costs.

Data Collection
The dataset comprises sensor readings from industrial equipment, including:

Temperature
Pressure
Vibration
Additionally, historical maintenance records are used to label the data with equipment failure events.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values and outliers
Feature engineering (e.g., rolling averages, lag features)
Splitting data into training and testing sets
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves:

Visualizing data patterns and correlations
Identifying significant features
Detecting seasonality and trends
Model Building
A Random Forest classifier is used to predict equipment failures. Key steps:

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Training the model with optimized parameters
Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:

Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)
Confusion Matrix
ROC AUC Score
Deployment
The model is deployed as a web service using Flask. The API accepts sensor data inputs and returns failure predictions.

Flask API
Endpoint: /predict
Method: POST
Input: JSON with sensor readings
Output: JSON with prediction and probability

Dependencies
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
